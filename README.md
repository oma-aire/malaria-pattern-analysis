FINAL PROJECT
PROJECT TITLE: Analysis of Malaria Dataset in Nigeria
PRESENTED BY: Nneoma Chidinma Eze

Introduction
Malaria is a significant public health concern in Nigeria, leading to considerable sickness and death rates. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of malaria cases diagnosed in Nigeria, focusing on various demographic, geographic, and clinical factors. The purpose of this document is to describe the dataset and outline the intended analysis.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 1,500 records of malaria patients diagnosed in Nigeria. The following columns are included:

1. Patient ID: A unique identifier assigned to each patient (e.g., PID0001).

2. Age: The age of the patient in years, providing insights into the age distribution of malaria cases.

3. Gender: The gender of the patient (Male or Female), which allows for analysis of malaria prevalence and outcomes by gender.

4. State: The geographical location where the patient resides (e.g., Lagos, Kano). This helps identify regional patterns of malaria incidence.

5. Local Government Area (LGA): A more specific administrative area within the state, aiding in detailed geographic analysis.

6. Diagnosis Date: The date on which the patient was diagnosed with malaria, facilitating temporal analysis of cases.

7. Malaria Type: The specific type of malaria parasite identified (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax), which is crucial for understanding the variations in treatment response.

8. Diagnosis Method: The method used to diagnose malaria (Microscopy or Rapid Diagnostic Test), allowing comparison of diagnostic effectiveness.

9. Treatment Type: The treatment administered to the patient (e.g., Antimalarial Drugs, Hospitalization), which provides insights into healthcare practices.

10. Prevention Method: The method used for malaria prevention (e.g., Mosquito Net, Insecticide Use), helping to evaluate prevention strategies.

11. Health Facility Type: The type of healthcare facility where the patient received treatment (e.g., Clinic, Hospital), allowing assessment of healthcare access.

12. Outcome: The result of the treatment (e.g., Recovered or Fatal), which is critical for evaluating treatment effectiveness.

13. Pre-existing Conditions: Any pre-existing health conditions of the patient (e.g., HIV, Anaemia), providing context for treatment outcomes.

14. Season of Diagnosis: The season during which the patient was diagnosed (e.g., Rainy Season, Dry Season), helping to identify seasonal trends in malaria cases.

Objectives of Analysis

The analysis of this dataset aims to achieve the following objectives:
1: Regional prevalence (which areas are most affected).
2:  Age and gender distribution (who is most affected).
3: Diagnosis and treatment types (what treatments are common for each diagnosis).
4: Explore seasonal trends in malaria cases to identify peak incidence periods.

1. Analyse demographic factors (age and gender) and their relationship with treatment outcomes.
2. Assess the geographic distribution of malaria cases across different states and LGAs.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic methods in determining malaria infection and treatment outcomes.
4. Investigate the types of treatments administered and their effectiveness based on patient demographics and malaria types.
5. Explore seasonal trends in malaria cases to identify peak incidence periods.
6. Identify the impact of pre-existing conditions on malaria severity and outcomes.
7. Provide recommendations for public health strategies based on the findings.

Conclusion

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of malaria in Nigeria. By analyzing the information contained within, we aim to uncover trends, relationships, and insights that can contribute to more effective public health interventions and resource allocation in combating malaria.
